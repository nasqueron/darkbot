You can control how Darkbot works using setup parameters.  You can
change these by directly editing setup.ini (when Darkbot is not running)
or by using the !set command (when logged in).  In setup.ini it will
look like this -

PARAMETER=value

Using the !set command will look like this -

!set PARAMETER=value

Using the !set command will save your changes to setup.ini.  Some of the
parameters will require a restart before they will be recognised.

Parameters are one of three different types, number, text, or boolean
(true or false).  For boolean values you can use any one of these to
specify "true" - true, 1, yes, ack, ok, one, positive, absolutely,
affirmative, ah ha, shit yeah, why not.  You can use any one of these to
specify "false" - false, 0, no, nack, nope, zero, negative, nah, no way,
get real, uh uh, fuck off, bugger off.  Only the first letter is
important, so there are many variations.

NOTE: Some of these parameters can only be set at compile time.  Exactly
which ones is currently subject to change, but they will all be
documented here in order to keep them in one place.  This can look like
this -

sh build.sh --enable-parameter1 --disable-parameter2 --with-parameter3=value

is.  We recommend keeping this disabled.


    ==== ON CONNECTION ====

PARAMATER	VERB
DEFAULT		true
TYPE		Boolean, Compile time
EXAMPLE		

Print out extra details while starting up?

 
PARAMATER	CHECK_STONED
DEFAULT		true
TYPE		Boolean, Compile time
EXAMPLE		

Check if servers are not responding, is so connect to next server in
list. (recommended) Some linux systems have problems with this. You'll
know if you're one of them if your bot disconnects every 5 minutes.

ALSO NOTE: If your bot seems to disconnect every 5 minutes, try turning
off CHECK_STONED.

 
PARAMATER	CONNECT_WAIT_TIMEOUT
DEFAULT		10
TYPE		Number

This is the time that darkbot will wait for a connection to the server,
before trying the next server. You may need to increase this if you are
on a slow connection. 


    ==== ON CONNECTED - IRC ==== 
 
PARAMATER	PERFORM_TIMER
DEFAULT		true
TYPE		Boolean

Send everything that's in PERFORM.INI to the IRC server every 60
seconds? Useful if the bot is banned, or X was split at the time darkbot

usually needed since darkbots tend to talk a lot.


    ==== ONJOIN ==== 
 
PARAMATER	DISPLAY_SYNC
DEFAULT		false
TYPE		Boolean

When bot joins a channel, sometimes it's hard to tell when it's "synced"
and is no longer processing stuff -- this tells the channel the bot has
finished syncing. For example, if you try to login while it's still
syncing, it may just ignore your login request until it sees you in the
channel.


================ DATABASE MANAGEMENT ================ 

    ==== ON START ==== 
 
PARAMETER	SORT
DEFAULT		false
TYPE		Boolean

Sort your info2.db on startup? Will take forever if u have a large db.
If you have dividers or any sort of markers on your database and you
want to preserve their position leave this directive undefined. Sorting
the database will put all items listed in alphabetic order.


PARAMETER	FIND_DUPS
DEFAULT		false
TYPE		Boolean

When user's do the INFO command, and at startup, do you want to find and
remove duplicates database entries?

 
PARAMATER	SAVE_DUPS

message to the bot.

 
PARAMATER	MSG_RESPONSES
DEFAULT		false

messages, turn this option on. Use the above two defines to allow /
disallow adding or deleting entries in private.


PARAMATER	ENCRYPT_PASSWORDS
DEFAULT		false
TYPE		Boolean, Compile time
EXAMPLE		

Toggles the use of encrypted passwords in the userlist.db file. Turn
this off if you don't want your passwords encrypted. Also note that if
you're using encrypted passwords and you decide to  turn this option
off, you'll need to redo your userlist.db file. Note: If you're new to
Darkbot, you may want to turn this option off.
 
 
PARAMATER	REQ_ACCESS_ADD

dat/logs/ dir).


==== SLEEP DIRECTIVES ==== 
 
PARAMATER	SLEEP_LEVEL
DEFAULT		3

EXAMPLE		

Level at which user's can make darkbot shut up (aka hush). This is
useful for help channels when they want darkbot to quit talking while
they address something important in the chan.

 
PARAMATER	SLEEP_TIME
DEFAULT		300
TYPE		Number

How many seconds to sleep for?

 
PARAMATER	GOSLEEP_ACTION
DEFAULT		"\1ACTION falls asleep... ZzzZZzzZZzz\1"
TYPE		Text

PARAMATER	WAKEUP_ACTION
DEFAULT		"\1ACTION wakes up from a snooze..\1"
TYPE		Text

What you would want your Darkbot to say when sleep and wake up commands
are issued? (If you want you can change what is between 'ACTION' and
'\1')


==== DATA SIZE ==== 
 
PARAMATER	MAX_DATA_SIZE
DEFAULT		400
TYPE		Number, Compile time
EXAMPLE		

The max length your database replies will be. This will be useful to
people loading their database into ram - if your data is all less than
400 chars, then you can save some ram.... Longer replies allows you to
do more, for example, with bitwise operator PIPE.

 
PARAMATER	MAX_TOPIC_SIZE
DEFAULT		50
TYPE		Number, Compile time
EXAMPLE		

The max length your database topics will be.


==== OUTPUTS - TIMERS ==== 
 
PARAMATER	LASTCOMM_TIME
DEFAULT		5
TYPE		Number

LASTCOMM_TIME is the length of time (in seconds) that your bot will not
reply to a topic already asked. Thus if someone asked your bot about
"mirc" that question could not be asked again in the same format for N
seconds (or till the question is out of buffer). This prevents the bot
from falling prey to users who like to repeat.


PARAMATER	OUTPUT1_COUNT
DEFAULT		4
TYPE		Number

PARAMATER	OUTPUT1_DELAY
DEFAULT		1
TYPE		Number

PARAMATER	OUTPUT2_COUNT
DEFAULT		6
TYPE		Number

PARAMATER	OUTPUT2_DELAY
DEFAULT		2
TYPE		Number

The output timers. Darkbot does not output text without first putting it
into a queue list. If the bot has several lines of text waiting to be
sent, it starts to delay longer and longer between output, so it can't
flood itself off of IRC. Explanation:

If text in queue is < OUTPUT1_COUNT, output it. If text in queue is >
OUTPUT1_COUNT, delay OUTPUT1_DELAY seconds. If queue is > OUTPUT2_COUNT,
delay OUTPUT2_DELAY seconds. If number of text in queue is higher than
OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT, then just delete all unneeded output (ie; any text
and notices, but leaving in stuff like kicks and modes) The defaults
below are recommended, as the bot isn't going to flood off. If you are
having the bot delete output messages and you'd like to increase the
queue, update the  OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT to a larger number. Just keep in
mind if someone floods your bot with a lot of VERSION requests, the bot
will sit there outputting a lot of version replies instead of deleting
them, causing it to act as if it's just sitting there not doing anything
when you ask it something in your channel.

 
PARAMATER	OUTPUT3_DELAY
DEFAULT		3
TYPE		Number

If still < OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT and > OUTPUT2_COUNT then delay
OUTPUT3_DELAY secs.

 
PARAMATER	OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT
DEFAULT		7
TYPE		Number

When all else fails... if more than OUTPUT_PURGE_COUNT delete them all!
No use in making the bot output slowly over a long period of time...
imagine if you set this to 50, and had an OUTPUT3_DELAY of 3 secs..
thats 50*3 secs till the bot is ready to output any new data to you!


======== OUTPUT MESSAGES ========

======== RANDOM STUFF ========= 
 
PARAMATER	RANDOM_STUFF
DEFAULT		true
TYPE		Boolean, Compile time
EXAMPLE		

Will read from a random line in dat/randomstuff.ini and say something
random in the home channel. ALSO if nothing is said in darkbot's home
channel it will say a randomstuff every  RAND_IDLE as long as no one
says anything. (default = define) UNDEFining this directive will not
allow you to add RDBs or randomstuff entries. If you really want your
bot not to say anything from randomstuff.ini and keed adding random
replies, increase the time _TIME and _IDLE defines to, for example,
54750, which corresponds to 365 days :)

PARAMATER	DO_CHANBOT_CRAP
DEFAULT		true
TYPE		Boolean, Compile time
EXAMPLE		

Enable this if you want to make your darkbot bloated with stuff like
!KICK, !UP, !WACK, etc. Basically anything dealing with channel modes

PARAMATER	HELP_GREET
DEFAULT		false
TYPE		Boolean

Give user's who join a NOTICE with info on how to use the darkbot? I
don't bother with this anymore since my bot knows how to respond to most
general questions users ask. If your bot is new and doesn't know much,
then you may want to have it tell people how to use it.


PARAMATER	AUTOHELP_GUESTS
DEFAULT		false
TYPE		Boolean

This define just sends a message to the channel, whenever a "Guest" user
joins, asking the user if they need any help. This is useful  for help
