The TO-DO List For Darkbot
----------------------------------------------------------
This is just a small file I made to help me remember what 
needs to be done, or is being suggested.  It may also be
useful to any other developers interested in contributing
to the Darkbot project.
----------------------------------------------------------

- chansrv.c badly needs to be revamped. needs a command
  structure that allows easy modification and addition,
  without the massive if-else-elseif structure it has
  currently.

- Multi-channel randomstuffs. I want to make it possible 
  for every channel specified in setup.ini as the home 
  channel, in the case of multiple home channels, has
  their own randomstuff timers that output randomstuffs
  according to the action going on, on each specific 
  channel.
